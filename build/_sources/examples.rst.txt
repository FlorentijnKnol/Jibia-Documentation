   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.
   
Examples
====================================   

Simple HTML Example
=============================
This javascript example shows how to implement jibia's search bar. The search bar should have 'searchbar' as its id like this:

::

	<input type="name" id = "searchbar" class = "zoekbalk" name="Search" placeholder="Zoekbalk van Jibia"></input>
	
To show the autocomplete results you need an empty div under this input field.

::

    <div id="data"></div>

This div will be filled with the search results. To finalize the implementation add the following script tag to
the bottom of your html document. Insert your own jibia search token in the token attribute:

::

<script src="js/jibia_search.js" token="YOUR TOKEN HERE"/>

The only thing left to do now is downloading jibia_search.js and adding this file to your js folder. Once this is done the
search bar should be up and running
